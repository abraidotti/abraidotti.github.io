title: Gotta start somewhere. I'm starting with Sinatra.
---

I'm currently a student at [NYCDA's](http://nycda.com) three-month Web Development Intensive bootcamp. There are about 18 other people in my cohort.

Our latest assignment is to use the Sinatra framework to create a message board-style app.

My costudents Chris, George, and I finished ours up a day early. Chris and George are great. The class took about a week to get through Sinatra routing basics, but George clued me in to using embedded Ruby (aka ERB) with dexterity.
Let's take a look at the first example:

As you can see in the commentary, George made some dynamically-updating buttons all in ERB, without using an javascript. I was impressed. Here's a video of the nav in action.
