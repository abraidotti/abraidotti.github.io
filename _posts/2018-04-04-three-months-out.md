title: Three Months Out of Bootcamp
---

I graduated NYCDA's web intensive bootcamp three months ago, and I've branched out to learn as much as I can in the web dev world.

Click on the arrows to see what I've explored:

### React
<details>
  <summary>
    Render component
  </summary>
  <p>I started by watching as many of Dan Abramov's conference videos and doing the tutorial on the official React site.</p>
  <p>I then read through the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">MDN Web Component docs</a> to learn how React wraps existing HTML features.</p>
  <p>After that, it was a matter understanding the props and state cycle. I'm still working on using the component lifecycle methods best, and I look forward to using the new Context API.</p>
  <p>Check out my baby single-page app made with React + React Router: <a href="http://reallyphilly.herokuapp.com">Really Philly</a>. My goal is to work on it some more and open it up to interested local developers.</p>

  <p>Up Next: rewriting my existing weather app, <a href="http://drizzl.herokuapp.com">drizzl</a>, in React.</p>

### Unity
<details>
  <summary>
    Load assets!
  </summary>
  <p>I've always been interested in game design, so I downloaded the Unity engine and did the roll-a-ball and space shooter tutorials.</p>
  <p>This has been a great introduction to C# and asset scripting, and I'd like to work on this kind of programming in the future, either for game design or animation. VR would be cool.</p>

  <p>Space can be so very lonely.</p>

### Elixir
<details>
  <summary>
    defp details do: click
  </summary>
  <p>I had heard awesome things about Elixir, including its humble origins as a telephony language. Back in bootcamp, I put it on the list of topics to explore when I got some time.</p>
  <p>I decided to start chronologically, back in the early 1980s, and I read about Ericsson's problems with their contemporary telephony code. This led me through the Erlang documentation and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfKtXYLG78">Erlang: The Movie</a>. (Definitely check that out.)</p>
  <p>I found an awesome exercise, <a href="http://elixirkoans.io/">Elixir Koans</a>, and a couple Phoenix tutorials.</p>

  <p>My favorite Elixir feature so far is pattern matching, as seen above.</p>

### DevOps
<details>
  <summary>
    Instantiate
  </summary>
  <p>I've come to realize I'm very much interested in back-end development, specifically in CI/CD engineering. That's not something I can easily practice outside of a professional production environment, so I've taken every opportunity I can find to learn.</p>
  <p>Recently, I participated in The Item's <a href="https://www.meetup.com/THEITEM/events/247233926/">Day Zero Hackathon</a>, at which I learned about various approaches to the CI/CD pipeline. I got to drive in my small group and instantiated an EC2 server and installed Jenkins.</p>

### Cash Flow PA and TDD
<details>
  <summary>

  <p><a href="http://cashflowpa.org">Cash Flow PA</a> lives! You can learn more about this open-source project I started with some friends on <a href="http://phrig.org/2018-01-28-cashflow-pa-summary/">PhRIG's site</a>.</p>
  <p>Our meeting with the Pennsylvania Governor's Office staff went really well! I've documented Cash Flow PA's current development in a <a href="http://phrig.org/2018-03-28-release-and-roadmap/">separate blog post</a>.</p>
  <p>As we rolled out v1, we've decided to shore up the app, which includes writing tests. Here's an example of a couple rspec tests I contributed to this past weekend.</p>

Otherwise, I've been cooking a lot, reading (latest rec: Patricia Lockwood's <em><a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/10/527629781/priestdaddy-shimmers-with-wonderful-obscene-life">Priestdaddy</a></em>), and playing some Overwatch here and there. Â¡Apagando las luces!
