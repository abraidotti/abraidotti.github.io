I recently developed [Drizzl](http://drizzl.herokuapp.com), a generative weather-art app, for my final project at NYCDA's three-mong web-development intensive program.

Inspired by [Tero Parviainen's](https://teropa.info/) excellent presentation on generative art, [https://teropa.info/loop/](“How Generative Music Works”), I set out to make an interactive app that uses weather data to inform the app's visual composition, rather than an algorithmic generator.

I discovered a number of emergent aspects during development. Here are a few:

![Buttons from forecast keys](img/2018-1-12-drizzl/2018-01-12-drizzl-object-keys.png "Buttons from forecast keys")

**Discovery #1**: The app's interactive features are procedurally generated.

The app first queries the [https://darksky.net/](Dark Sky) weather API with the user's location and then iterates through the forecast returned to the client as a JSON object. (If you'd like, you can open the browser's console and examine the forecast object.)

The result: there are no static buttons. For example, when I input the lat and lng of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouvet_Island](most remote island on earth), I get the following buttons and a pretty sparse animation:

This scarcity of buttons confused me at first, but I now presume the lack of forecast data is due to the low demand for weather (and weather equipment) at that spot. The same happens if you search Antarctica.

**Discovery #2**:

I figured out how to shoehorn as many variables as possible into an  [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API](html canvas element) animation.

Learning to make the animation itself was tricky. I started by searching for html canvas animations on [https://codepen.io/search/pens?q=canvas%20animation](CodePen), copying or forking them, breaking them, and then trying to fix them. After about 10 animations, I learned enough to create my own simple particle flow. You can hit up Drizzl's [https://github.com/abraidotti/drizzl](github repo) for the full code, but as you can see below, I implemented quite a few animation variables for interactivity:

![Drizzl animation variables](img/2018-1-12-drizzl/2018-01-12-drizzl-variables.png "Drizzl animation variables").

To see each of these variables in action, open the console when the app is running and you'll see messages indicating what each button does.

**Discovery #3**:

As a novice to web development, but an old (and quite amateur) hand at art, I rediscovered a lesson that consistently rings true: you're never really done art until you package it up, ship it off, and move on to the next project.

With that said, I began to implement but ultimately dropped effective use of a database so users can save and share forecasts. If you take a look at app.js, you'll see I've already set up an Mlab database, but I haven't implemented its use. That also begs the question: would users actually save and share their forecasts? I don't see a reason to do so right now. Maybe if a user could save the state of their interactivity and then share it, they would, but that will remain unsolved until I learn a dynamic view library like React.

Still, I want to point out that even though this is a single page app, the forecast is requested by the server and rendered to the client:

![Drizzl routing]({{ img/2018-1-12-drizzl/2018-01-12-routing.png }} "Drizzl routing").

I initially struggled with rendering the forecast back from the server to the client, but I solved this problem by hiding the forecast in an H3 tag, grabbing it, and then deleting the H3 tag:

![Server-client forecast hack](img/2018-1-12-drizzl/2018-01-12-forecast-hack.png "Server-client forecast hack").

I have no doubt there's a routine, elegant solution to this problem, but I like my method for its novelty. When you lack an umbrella, you can always use a trash bag. :)
Thanks for reading!
