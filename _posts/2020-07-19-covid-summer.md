Love (for the Pine Barrens) in time of Covid-19.

Otherwise, so much indoor time reading, coding, and video games. Trying to stay off [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sandy___beaches) and slow down the news.

This website will soon disappear. You can check out my new [site](https://sandrobraidotti.com) as I develop it.
