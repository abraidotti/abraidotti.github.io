### Hi.

My name's Alessandro Braidotti (Sandro for short). I'm a web developer.
Before I learned how to make websites, I [taught writing and literature](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1321388) at Temple University and then worked at a [publishing startup](http://www.bookbaby.com).

### Web development

I recently graduated NYCDA's three-month Web Development Intensive bootcamp in Philadelphia, and I'm looking for my first full-time dev job.

I like to involve myself in cool projects that use hardware, geography, and sound, but I'm up for any kind of coding challenge.

### Related pursuits

A few years ago, I cofounded a coding group with some friends. We called it the Philadelphia Research and Innovation Group ([https://phrig.github.io/](PhRIG) for short). We recently participated in a recent state-sponsored [https://technical.ly/philly/2017/11/03/final-projects-code4pa-hackathon/](Hackathon), and our project has gotten some attention from the governor's office.

I also [fix video game consoles](#) as a side hustle.
