My name's Alessandro Braidotti (Sandro for short). I'm a web developer interested in user interface design.

### Ongoing pursuits

- The *Philadelphia Research and Innovation Group* ([PhRIG](https://phrig.github.io/) for short) is going strong. We recently participated in 2017's [Code4PA Hackathon](https://technical.ly/philly/2017/11/03/final-projects-code4pa-hackathon/), and our project has gotten some attention from the governor's office.

- I play bass guitar and sing in a goth-punk band, [Inspector Moon](http://inspectormoon.bandcamp.com), with Nick DeAngelo and [Alex Vallejo](http://desperate.horse/).

##### Writing
- *[Barcelona, 1972](https://thecollapsar.org/the-collapsar-archive/2016/02/19/barcelona-1972-by-sandro-braidotti)*
is a short story published in *The Collapsar*, an online literary journal, in 2016.

### Previous pursuits

Before I learned how to make websites, I [taught writing and literature](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1321388) at Temple University and then worked at a [publishing startup](http://www.bookbaby.com).

I also fix video game consoles as a side hustle.

#### About this site

This blog is a fork of the excellent Jekyll Now static site generator and theme provided by [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). It uses Markdown and Sass for styling.
