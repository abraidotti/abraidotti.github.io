### Hi.

My name's Alessandro Braidotti (Sandro for short). I'm a web developer interested in user interface design. Before I learned how to make websites, I [taught writing and literature](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1321388) at Temple University and then worked at a [publishing startup](http://www.bookbaby.com).

### Other pursuits

A couple years ago, I cofounded a coding group with some friends and [one of those friends](http://www.williambolton.com/) named it the Philadelphia Research and Innovation Group ([PhRIG](https://phrig.github.io/) for short). We recently participated in 2017's [Code4PA Hackathon](https://technical.ly/philly/2017/11/03/final-projects-code4pa-hackathon/), and our project has gotten some attention from the governor's office.

I also fix video game consoles as a side hustle.

#### About this site

This blog is a fork of the excellent Jekyll Now static site generator and theme provided by [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). It uses Markdown and Sass for styling.
