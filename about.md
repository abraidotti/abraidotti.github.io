My name's Alessandro Braidotti (Sandro for short). I'm a web developer interested in user interface design. ([Resume here]({{ site.url }}/downloadable/alessandro-braidotti-resume.pdf)).

Before I learned how to make websites, I [taught writing and literature](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1321388) at Temple University and then worked at a [publishing startup](http://www.bookbaby.com).

#### Ongoing stuff

- [PhRIG](https://phrig.github.io/), the Philadelphia Research and Innovation Group, comprises me and some friends here in Philly. We take on software and hardware projects.

- I like to write. "[Barcelona, 1972](https://thecollapsar.org/the-collapsar-archive/2016/02/19/barcelona-1972-by-sandro-braidotti)"
is a short story I wrote that was published in *The Collapsar* in 2016.

#### About this site

 This blog is a fork of the excellent Jekyll Now theme by [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). It uses Sass for styling and Shopify's Liquid template language inside Markdown.
